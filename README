 *
 * NRGridView is a library which has been developed by Louka Desroziers, for Novedia Regions.
 * Novedia Regions is a french company that develops apps for mobile devices.
 *
 * How it works? Almost like UITableView works. You set a dataSource, and a delegate.. and you implement all @required methods.
 *
 * If you got any suggestions, or if you need any furthermore UITableView-like methods (like -scrollToItemAtIndexPath:animated:, or whatever), do not hesitate to email me at l.desroziers@novediagroup.com
